TASK 3: Handwritten Character Recognition
Objective: Identify handwritten characters or alphabets.
Approach: Use image processing and deep learning.
Key Features:
● Dataset: MNIST (digits), EMNIST (characters).
● Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
● Extendable to full word or sentence recognition with sequence modeling (like CRNN).
